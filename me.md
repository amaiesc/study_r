*About me:*

I am a data scientist working for private companies (both in TH and in SG; see my resume above). 
I am also an adjunct lecturer (occasionally) at the Psychology Faculty, Chulalongkorn University, 
      where I received my B.Sc. and M.A. in Social Psychology.

I created this website for the sake of my own storytelling and teaching skills. 
      However, anyone can access the topics listed below and hopefully my cats will learn some basic R skills here.

By the way, if you have any questions or urgently need a statistical consultant, 
      please email me with the subject CATS HELP!!.
